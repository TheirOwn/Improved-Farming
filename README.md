# Improved-Farming
Datapack for Minecraft that tweaks plants and composters


There are two changes this pack adds to vanilla minecraft:

## Auto Planting
Seeds and Saplings now automatically replant themselves. By default this happens instantly, but this can be changed in the options. This does work with dispensers.


## Improved Composting
First you'll need a special composter:
To Create a Special composter: Toss a diamond in a composter

Then, after it is filled, when it finishes composting, by default you'll be given 9 bonemeal. In the options that amount can be changed between 4, 9, and 16. 

In addition, in the options, you can change it so that all special composters instead reward dirt, but take slightly longer to compost.

## The Menu
To access the menu to modify settings: /reload

To uninstall: /reload
Then click on the option that says Deactivate this mod
