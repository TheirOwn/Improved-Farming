# Improved-Farming
Datapack for Minecraft that tweaks plants and composters


There are two changes this pack adds to vanilla minecraft:

## Auto Planting
Seeds and Saplings now automatically replant themselves. By default this happens instantly, but this can be changed in the options. This does work with dispensers. 
In the options you can also modify it so that saplings do not automatically replant themselves.
The seeds that can replant themselves are: beetroot seeds, carrots, melon seeds, nether wart, potato, pumpkin, and wheat seeds.


## Improved Composting
First you'll need a special composter:
To Create a Special composter: Toss a diamond in a composter. There will be a tiny particle effect and that's it. (Placeholder for now)

Then, after it is filled, when it finishes composting, by default you'll be given 9 bonemeal. In the options that amount can be changed between 4, 9, and 16. 

In addition, in the options, you can change it so that all special composters instead reward dirt, but take slightly longer to compost.

## The Menu
To access the menu to modify settings: /reload

To uninstall: /reload
Then click on the option that says Deactivate this mod


## Future Plans
Eventually I plan on improving the special composters to appear visually distinct somehow. 
Hoppers are working 99% of the time. I think in some cases, you will gain one extra bonemeal. 
Bamboo, cactus, and reeds will all be added eventually.
I am open to suggestions, if you message me here or on reddit to /u/TheirOwn
